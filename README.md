# Welcome to my repository. This dataset was handled on many platform. Data include weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information. The task is to predict daily bike demand. 
# In this project, I began with EDA-Steps. I have taken looks at data generally. After Cleaning, Preprocessing, preparing I have executed the Models in ML and DL. So , Linear, Ridge, Lasso, XGboost, Random Forest, Decission Tree, LSTM. 
# In "Models-file" , I have visualized the Results.
